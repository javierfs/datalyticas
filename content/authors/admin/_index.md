Javier Fernández is a Data Scientist and Analyst. He believes in the power of data and how it could make impacts in business decisions: He has worked in multiple projects across different industries (Finance, Insurance, Healthcare, Media, Energy...) achieving reduction of costs and time by creating systems that automate manual repetitive tasks.

He has created from scratch machine learning supervised and unsupervised models and deployed them into production at the cloud using mainly Amazon Web Services.
His background in Telecommunication engineering and machine learning/medical engineering has provided him an analytical mind which put attention to detail on hidden data insights. He has experienced in data processing, data visualisation and reporting as well as data modelling and prediction. He has coded in multiple languages (Java, C, C#, Python, R, Assembly, javascript...) He also has used different technologies such as Alteryx, RStudio, Databricks in order to retrieve and process data. 

On top of his technical abilities, Javier has gained a very good business sense during his experience in both professional industries and academia. He believes that a data scientist should excel in communication as the data insights must be explained in collaboration with the domain experts, and therefore domain knowledge is essential to exploit the data information.

Javier is a proactive person, who acts comfortable under new challenges by adapting quickly to different environments and suggesting new strategies to approach the problems.
